# EE5 Project Helios

This repository contains all the code files necessary for our smart sensor system that will monitor Compartment Fire Behaviour Training(cfbt).

The development of this project was managed via the **Agile SCRUM** method.

My role in this project was the development of the temperature sensor. It spans over the BLE_files, SPI_communication_with_MAX31856 and finally Final_SensorDevice branches.
